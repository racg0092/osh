# `0SH 0CTISHELL`

`0ctishell` is a cross platform shell. As a software developer I spend most of my time in the terminal. At home I use Linux but at work I'm required to use Windows. I want to be able to use the same shell in both and have the commands translate across platforms. Most of all I want to understand how shells work (this is the main reason).

`Why the Name ? My kid likes Octopus meet 0cti.`
