# OSH OCTUSHELL

Octushell is a cross platform shell. As a software developer I spend most of my time in the terminal. At home I use Linux but at work I'm required to use Windows. I want to be able to use the same shell in both and have the commands translate across platforms. Most of all I want to understand how shells work.

`Why the Name ? My kid likes Octupus so why not.`
